# Tik-Tak-Toe Game

Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## How to play 
Here's how the game is typically played:

The game begins with an empty grid of 3 rows and 3 columns.
Two players take turns, one using X and the other using O, to mark their symbols in empty cells.
The first player usually starts by placing their symbol in any empty cell.
The players continue taking turns until one of the following conditions is met:
A player has three of their symbols in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This player wins the game.
All cells on the grid are filled, but neither player has achieved a winning combination. In this case, the game ends in a draw.
If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, both players have the option to play again.
Tic-tac-toe is a game of strategy and foresight. Skilled players aim to create winning patterns while also blocking their opponent from doing the same. Due to the relatively simple nature of the game and limited grid size, optimal play will often result in a draw.
