# Tik-Tak-Toe Game

Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols (either X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## How to play 
Here's how the game is typically played:

The game begins with an empty grid of 3 rows and 3 columns.
Two players take turns, one using X and the other using O, to mark their symbols in empty cells.
The first player usually starts by placing their symbol in any empty cell.
The players continue taking turns until one of the following conditions is met:
A player has three of their symbols in a row, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This player wins the game.
All cells on the grid are filled, but neither player has achieved a winning combination. In this case, the game ends in a draw.
If a player wins or the game ends in a draw, both players have the option to play again.
Tic-tac-toe is a game of strategy and foresight. Skilled players aim to create winning patterns while also blocking their opponent from doing the same. Due to the relatively simple nature of the game and limited grid size, optimal play will often result in a draw.

## Data Model

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


## Testing 


### Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Credits 

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 

You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
